# AI-Powered Design System

## Overview
This project showcases the development of an innovative design system that leverages artificial intelligence to streamline the design process and maintain consistency across products.

## Key Features
- AI-powered component generation
- Automated style guide maintenance
- Real-time design consistency checks
- Integration with popular design tools
- Customizable design tokens

## Technical Implementation
The system was built using React and TypeScript, with a focus on type safety and component reusability. The AI integration was implemented using custom algorithms trained on design patterns and best practices.

## Impact
The implementation of this design system has significantly improved the efficiency of our design process and ensured consistent user experiences across all products.
