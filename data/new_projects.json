      "Short Summary": "I was tasked with creating a website for a chiropractic clinic that had previously only had a presence on Google Business. Through research and iteration on the design, I was able to create a website that matched the clinic's brand identity and provided users with clear, concise information about the services offered at the clinic. The website has received significant traffic and has resulted in an increase in business for the clinic, as well as positive feedback from both my client and his staff.",

      "Challenge": "<p id=\"\">Dr. Petrilli owned a chiropractic clinic that had been in operation for several years. While the business had a strong presence on Google Business, it did not have a website. As a result, Dr. Petrilli was missing out on the opportunity to reach a wider audience and provide potential patients with more information about his services. The objective of this project was to create a website for Chiropractic Healthcare that would allow new patients to contact the business for chiropractic care.</p>",
      "Approach": "<p id=\"\">First, I conducted a competitor analysis of the most successful chiropractors, both locally and nationally. This allowed me to understand the aesthetic standards for chiropractic websites and identify areas where the clinic could stand out from its competitors. In addition to the competitor analysis, I also researched industry trends to identify the most effective ways to organize and present information on the website. This included researching best practices for SEO to ensure that the website was optimized for search engines and would rank well in search results. Finally, I interviewed the receptionist at the clinic to get a better understanding of the information that users needed in order to get started with chiropractic care. This helped me to identify the most important pieces of information to include on the website and ensure that the website was user-friendly and easy to navigate.</p>",
      "Solution": "<p id=\"\">I aimed to make the website feel simple and professional for those seeking medical help for health issues. To achieve this, I kept the design clean and minimalistic, and used easy-to-read fonts and plenty of white space. With limited branding to work with, my goal for the website's design was to establish a strong brand identity for the chiropractic clinic. To do this, I used their famous red sign for inspiration including the font and color to create a logo and an interactive loading animation.</p><p id=\"\">Throughout the website, I used red for buttons, icons, and as a background color, while keeping the main body of the website white to create a simple and professional look. This color scheme helped to establish a cohesive and consistent look for the website, while also aligning with the clinic's existing branding.</p><p id=\"\">Overall, my goal was to create a website that looked professional and trustworthy for those seeking medical help, while also incorporating elements of the clinic's brand identity to create a cohesive and cohesive look.</p><p id=\"\">‍</p>",

      "Results": "<p id=\"\">The website for the chiropractic clinic has had a significant impact on the business since its launch.
